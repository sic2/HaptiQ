A Haptic Device for Graph and Text Exploration by People with Visual Disabilities

===============================================================================

Student: Simone Ivan Conte
Supervisor: Miguel A. Nacenta

Project Description:

Traditional touchscreen devices do not provide any tactile feedback, being then of scarce usability for people with visual disabilities.
Miguel A. Nacenta and his team at the University of Calgary, now a Lecturer in St Andrews, developed the Haptic TableTop Puck (HTP), an inexpensive tactile feedback input device to be used on digital tabletop surfaces. Friction, height, texture, and malleability are communicated through a combination of properties of the HTP: a rod and a brake pad controlled by two servo motors, and a pressure sensor on the rod. The HTP, however, uses only one actuator on a finger to convey information to the user, which makes it unsuitable for use by people with visual disabilities, since people cannot detect directions and edges of tactile objects.

The aim of this project is to extend the HTP concept and overcome some of its limitations for its use for people with visual disabilities. The extension will consist into using multiple servo motors and rods as well as redesigning the HTP to support new functionalities, such as dynamic cursor pointing.
 
My hypothesis is that the extended HTP will facilitate the recognition of directions and edges of displayed objects. The first main objective is to create a physical prototype that is adapted for the specific needs of people with visual disabilities. The second main objective is to perform empirical testing of the device in order to demonstrate any improvements compared to the current HTP.
