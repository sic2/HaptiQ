\begin{itemize}
	\item evaluate HaptiQ through a user study (this will be done by Regis)
	\item additional tactons
    \item improve the mechanics of the HaptiQ and restructure the servos position so to minimise the overall dimension of the device
    \item combine the use of the HaptiQ and other inputs, like fingers. 
    \item add a break to device for simulating friction
    \item increase resolution of HaptiQ
    \item rotate device on itself to allow higher resolution
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item evaluate the learning rate for blind people in terms of behaviours of the device
    \item possible experiment --> use of HaptiQ with audio VS audio only (like VoiceOver in iphone)
\end{itemize}
