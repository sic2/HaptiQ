\chapter{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
	\item evaluate HaptiQ through a user study (this will be done by Regis)
	\item additional tactons
    \item improve the mechanics of the HaptiQ and restructure the servos position so to minimise the overall dimension of the device
    \item combine the use of the HaptiQ and other inputs, like fingers. 
    \item add a break to device for simulating friction
    \item increase resolution of HaptiQ
    \item rotate device on itself to allow higher resolution
\end{itemize}
