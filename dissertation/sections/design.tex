\begin{enumerate}
	\item Hardware design
	\item MHTP API architecture
    	\begin{enumerate}
        	\item Factory pattern with reflection in combination with delegation pattern was used to abstract the input from the touch screen device and notify the MHTP manager system
            \item Observer pattern is used to notify haptic shapes about any new input
            \item Bytetags (or glyphs?) were used to get input from touch screen device
        \end{enumerate}
    \item MHTP API allows both high and low level manipulation of the device (in a similar fashion to HTP toolkit)
    \item Behaviour design
    \item Text exploration using SpeechSynthetiser
\end{enumerate}
