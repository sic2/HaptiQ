\chapter{Evaluation and Future Work}

\todo{future work section ?}

\begin{itemize}
	\item feedback from Saad and french guy?
	\item increase resolution
    \item evaluate MHTP with users (this will be done)
    \item increase the number of behaviours
    \item improve the servos structural position so to minimise the overall dimensions of the device
    \item alternative actuators positions (see Piatrzak paper: Creating usable pin array tactons for nonvisual information)
    \item combine the use of MHTP and finger detection
    \item can use hidden-markov-model or time-series-analysis to identify patterns in pressure input and classify gestures
    \item evalute the learning rate for blind people in terms of behaviours of the device
    \item possible experiment --> use of MHTP with audio VS audio only (like VoiceOver in iphone)
    \item add a break to the device !?
\end{itemize}
