\begin{itemize}
    \item alternative actuators positions (see Piatrzak paper: Creating usable pin array tactons for nonvisual information)
    \item can use hidden-markov-model or time-series-analysis to identify patterns in pressure input and classify gestures
    \item evalute the learning rate for blind people in terms of behaviours of the device
    \item possible experiment --> use of MHTP with audio VS audio only (like VoiceOver in iphone)
