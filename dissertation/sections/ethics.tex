\section{Collaborations}
This project involved collaborations with two students: Saad Attieh and Rejis Ongaro-Carcy.  

Saad Attieh, University of St Andrews, joined the project as a collaborator, under the approval of the School of Computer Science of the University of St Andrews, in November 2013. Meetings with Saad were established about every month and he has provided very useful feedback on the device design and tactons. 

Rejis Ongaro-Carcy, Universit√© de Strasbourg - ISIS, joined the project on the \nth{18} March 2014. Rejis is using the MHTP as part of his Master's thesis focused on designing a strategic game, based on geographical information, for visually impaired people. He has provided some insightful feedback, but has not contributed actively to any parts of the code and the design of the hardware.
