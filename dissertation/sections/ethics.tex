\section{Collaborations}
\label{sec:collaborators}
This project involved collaborations with two students: Saad Attieh and Rejis Ongaro-Carcy.  

Saad Attieh, University of St Andrews, joined the project as a collaborator, under the approval of the School of Computer Science of the University of St Andrews, in November 2013. Meetings with Saad were established about every month and he has provided very useful feedback on the device design and tactons. 

Régis Ongaro-Carcy, Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse - IRIT - of the Université de Toulouse, joined the project on the \nth{18} March 2014. Régis is using the HaptiQ as part of his Master's thesis focused on designing a strategic game, based on geographical information, for visually impaired people. He has provided some insightful feedback. While using the API, Régis found some bugs or features that should be added. He reported these issues through the issue tracking system of GitHub.
