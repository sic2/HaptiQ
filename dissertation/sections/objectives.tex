\chapter{Objectives}


\begin{enumerate}
	\item Primary
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item Design and implement an haptic device for graph exploration by people with visual disabilities
        \item Design and implement haptic device for text exploration by people with visual disabilities
        \item Develop an API for the Haptic Device
        \item Design and implement an application for Graphs exploration
        \item Develop an API for WPF client applications
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Secondary
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item Design and implement an application for Cartesian Graph exploration
        \item Increase the haptic device resolution
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Tertiary
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item Enable the haptic device to be used collaboratively
        \item Enable the haptic device to sense textures
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

All the primary objectives were achived. The secondary objective (b) was also achieved. 

The seconday objectives, in semester one, included also the implementation of dynamic pointing. This feature, however, was removed for reasons discussed later in Chapter 7.

In addition to the objectives above, I pursued this project with the following other goals in mind:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Investigate and evaluate the current state of the art.
    \item Develop a device which fits within the current state of the art.
    \item Develop a flexible API that could be easily used to implement other various applications and experiments.
    \item Develop a modular device which can be easily adapted to various conditions and needs.
\end{itemize}
