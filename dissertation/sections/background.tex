\chapter{Background/Context Survey}

This section addresses various haptic feedback techonologies. In order to design and implement the haptic device this project is about, I need to present some of the early and current haptic technology. This will help to understand the current state of the art and where it is heading.

Research in haptic perception and visualization has grown significantly in the last 25 years \cite{roberts2007we}. Being able to cover most of the work in haptics is not feasible. Therefore, I will present only the most significant related work to this project. 

\section{Current Haptic feedback technology}
This sections briefly covers the current haptic feedback technology used by the visually impaired.

More on the current state of research in haptic technology can be found in Chapter 3. 

    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item Braille and static maps
        \item Voice "tracking?" - like the one used by Apple for maps (VoiceOver)
        \item Others? \todo{google technology for the blind}
    \end{enumerate}
    
\section{Static Feedback}

TODO\todo{include anke broke paper}

\section{Feedback by Mechanical Actuators}
\subsection{PHANTOM}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item User study from Glasgow University on Cartesian Graphs perception
\end{enumerate}

\section{Haptics by Electrovibration}


\subsection{Revel}

Predecessor is TeslaTouch - revel works the opposite direction

Introducing the concept of ARTactile displays: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Extrinsic haptic: integrated in the environment
    \item Intrinsic haptic: augment the user
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{FingerFlux}

\section{Haptics through air}
- Ultrahaptics
- AIREAL


\section{Changable surfaces}


\subsection{Changeable Physical Buttons}

Major problem: display is static. Must be created in advance.
