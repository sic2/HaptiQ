This section addresses various haptic feedback techonologies. One of the main aims of this project is not only to create the next HTP, but also to address some of the limitations of other recent haptic technology. 

Research in haptic visualization has grown significantly in the last 25 years \cite{roberts2007we}. Being able to cover most of the work in haptics is not feasible. I will start by presenting the PHANTOM, one of the most significant haptic devices of the 90s, and then present some more recent work to understand what the current state of the art is and where it is heading.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item User study from Glasgow University on Cartesian Graphs perception

Another technology recently developed by Disney Research is AIREAL. AIREAL is (TODO - Describe). 

The main advantages of AIREAL are that it's scalable, inexpensive and can be easily used in public spaces. On the other hand, however, high-resolution tactile feedback represents a major challenge. 

The work presented by Sodhi et Al. seems to be very portable for gaming applications, where "feeling" the environment can enhance a better user experience. Nonetheless, this technology does not seeem particularly suitable for graph exploration, especially for the visually impaired. Text exploration is also not feasible, since AIREAL functions as an output device only, therefore the user cannot query the user for the wanted information.

Predecessor is TeslaTouch - revel works the opposite direction

Introducing the concept of ARTactile displays: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Extrinsic haptic: integrated in the environment
    \item Intrinsic haptic: augment the user
\end{enumerate}

Major problem: display is static. Must be created in advance.
