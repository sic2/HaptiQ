\section{Abstract}

The use of technology for the blind and the visually impaired is not obvious. Overcoming this digital divide gap is one of today's challenged. Current technology provides either expensive or not-flexible devices. 
This report investigates both commercial devices, used by visually impaired people, and the state of the art of haptic feedback devices. 

Some of the limitations of the current technology are addressed in this project, by introducing the HaptiQ, the first haptic feedback vector-based display for people with visually disabilities. This project involves the creating of the HaptiQ device, an easy-to-use API supporting it, a new set of dynamic behaviours and two example applications.
