\chapter{Conclusions}

Technology, in the last decade, has become always more ubiquitous. However, little effort has been spent on enabling the digital world to be used by people with disabilities. Blind people, in particular, have to face considerable difficulties when trying to access textual and visual information. While, screen readers are able to convey textual information with a good degree of success, the same is not true for more graphical data.

This project presents the HaptiQ, an inexpensive haptic-audio feedback device that the visually impaired can use on interactive surfaces to explore both textual and graphical information. The main focus of the HaptiQ is to facilitate the blind to sense edges, corners and directions.
